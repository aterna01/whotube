higher conversion rate of potential to actual users?


###### JAMIE - 

1 - youTube Insta

2 - yesterday eve

3 - 4 hours

4 - yes 2 main ones

5 - yes insta

6 - yes more info on insta
more day to day on insta
youtube is only every few days
updates don't always make it to videos

7 - follow on recommended videos on youtube

8 - seems unnecessary to combine
site might not do a good job of combining them
more social media might be better split up
depends on how it works
might be better to see one person in one place
seperated it is in more digestable chunks
one long feed is a lot and could be overwhelming
would give it a try if available

9 - 26

10 - male
